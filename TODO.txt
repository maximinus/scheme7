Issues found converting, active:

	Don't allow turning when landed
	Increase friction when touching ground
	Final mission objective does not trigger
	Add click sound when changing lights
	Add dialog on screen when playing
	Add title screen to start

Solved bugs so far:
	Enter button not shown
	Second dialog not shown
	"Press Enter" in wrong place
	Sound doesn't stop playing
	Text overflows box
	Needs an "enter pressed" sound
	Glitch does not overlay whole screen
	Error null loader on transition scene
	Electric barrier shader not working
	Cannot have velocity as ship value
	Funcref not allowed for callbacks
	Remove Tween from Mission Objectives
	Current shaders are not Godot 4 compatible
	Default objectives are empty
	Do not know keys
	Normal and velocity are no longer properties of a collision
	No invert function for GdScript array
	Mission complete shader currently broken
	Game crashes on a collision
	Fix current collision messing up position when stationary
	Some tilemap tiles are offset
	Fix all unused parameters in functions
	Mission objectives need aligning
	Mission complete objectives move around early
	Remove final funcrefs
	Highlight current objective
	Play sound when objective met


Improvements:

* Input:
	Allow key maps to be shown and redefined
		Current keys: W/A/D - Thrust and turn
					  L/K   - Lights
					  P     - Pause
					  Space - Fire laser
					  M     - Download
					  Enter - Select dialog

* Objective display
	Objectives need reward sound
	Current objective needs highlight
	Finishing objective needs simple glow and fade animation


Base game improvements
	Needs a flow of title screen -> tutorial #1 dialog -> tutorial level.
	From level:
		Death screen (simple dialog)
		Complete screen
	The dialog needs to continue in the tutorial levels, so the game is literally telling you what to do
	The tutorial levels need a CRT display for the non-dialog
	A starting screen might be nice. Likely some kind of shader animation
