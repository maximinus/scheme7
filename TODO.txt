TODO List and project path
--------------------------

Currently version 0.2

Short term plan
---------------

When these are done, we formulate the next piece of work to do.
This next version is 0.3

The goal is to complete the training missions. For this, we need to do the following:

    The tutorial missions need to cover:
        Lights
        Engines
        Guns
        Tractor Beam


The immediate tasks required to fulfill the above:
	Add a tutorial misson
		"use guns to destroy something"
		"pick up orb and move up"
	The dialogs must be loaded by the scenes


Long term plan
--------------

This is what should be in future versions:

0.4:    The dialog should be improved and more professional
        The first real missions should be added, maybe 3 or 4 and quite easy, adding a new element every level
        There needs to be a "system" screen" showing the current planetary system
            This acts as the main inter-level screen
        The level parts need:
            Buttons to open fences
            The electric fence
            Guns
            Push and pullers
            Landing pads

0.5:    An "edit the ship" screen is needed
        Add some optional extra tutorials for the instrumentation and orb
        The mission with the AI orb needs to be added
        At this point we have a game with 6 or more tutorials and about 5/6 levels, a ship edit and planetary screen
        There should be some music at this point

0.6:    This release should be about polish. Involving:
            Fixing the look and feel
            Making the sounds better
            Remove all possible copyright material
            Fully integrating with steam
        Fix all cuts that would slow down moving ahead


This list is "all the things that need doing", and is both non-prioritised and not in any order.
Essentially a dumping ground for all the things that need doing


    Allow keys to be viewed and edited from the starting screen
    Save the game at points and make "continue" an option
	Don't allow turning when landed
	Increase friction when touching ground
    Build an executbale for the Steam Deck
        Add steam deck controls
    Add a menu "exit / quit to title screen / restart from last save" to pause screen
    Add the energy defence speed
    Add the orb with vertlet physics
    Add push/pull level elements
    Add enemy guns
    Add enemy missiles

	Default objectives are empty
	Do not know keys
	Normal and velocity are no longer properties of a collision
	No invert function for GdScript array
	Mission complete shader currently broken
	Game crashes on a collision
	Fix current collision messing up position when stationary
	Some tilemap tiles are offset
	Fix all unused parameters in functions
	Mission objectives need aligning
	Mission complete objectives move around early
	Remove final funcrefs
	Mission complete screen was wrong size

Future Improvements


Base game improvements
	Needs a flow of title screen -> tutorial #1 dialog -> tutorial level.
	From level:
		Death screen (simple dialog)
		Complete screen
	The dialog needs to continue in the tutorial levels, so the game is literally telling you what to do
	The tutorial levels need a CRT display for the non-dialog
	A starting screen might be nice. Likely some kind of shader animation
