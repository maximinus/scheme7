TODO:

* Done
? Is this right
- Skip for later

- 22nd Jan:
	* Fix the bug in the chevrons for the heat dial
	? Fix the bug where taking off after a long time has crazy force
	* Change the graphics in the heat dial
	* Wire up the battery
	* Add a light object that can be destroyed
	- Add a battery rocket thrust
	- Add ambient light based on these lights

- 29th Jan:
	* Add gunfire from the ship
	- Improve the SFX, and try music
	* Handle the player entrance on the scene at the start (like a teleport animation)
	* Add mission objectives as text overlay (setup from global data object)
	* Add door
	* Update level
	* Add fuel gauge
	* Add damage gauge

- 5th Feb

	* Fix pause screen pausing on death
	* Detect when on lander
	* Add data transfer animation
	* Store objectives in global object with level
	* Detect objectives complete and remove them
	- Add a menu to the pause
	- Add energy shield
	* Make a new level, please. Shouldn't take that long
	* Add a dialog screen
		* Make it the start scene
	* Make second level
		* Now have Dialog > Level > Dialog > Level
		* If you die, go back to start of level
	* Put all decision code into player class in globals
		* That's the decision to do or not. The actual code for
		* moving the ship can still be in the player
	* Model the rocket and player as objects exposed globally and cleanup code
		* AKA "Decide what the boundary is"

- 12th Feb?

	* Find some way to inject data into the starting player on a level
		* Maybe needs a Ship() class different from a Player()
	* Build a level with restricted use because of this
	* Improve objectives and script a training level "Turn the lights on"
	* Handle the winning situation with a scene fade
	* Load next scene in background
	* Start the ship fully landed
	Add "Takeoff to given height", "land somewhere", "shoot something"

- 19th Feb?

	* Add some dialog
		* The character is a simple AI that comes with you
		Upgrade the dialog screen so you can choose options
		Change the highlight to a moving pointy thing
		Add a portrait for the dialog character
		Write better text for the tutorial
	Add some tutorial levels.
		- This needs practice levels that have a heavy shader to look virtual
	Add the ball with verlet physics
		Add tractor beam graphic and mechanic
		Add collision detection to ball
	Add "control verlet ball" - probably 2 levels

- 26th Feb?

	Add "stuff" to the levels
		* Doors
		Blowers and suckers
		Enemy guns
		* Downloading
	Add some new levels

- 5th Mar?
	Add particles that move away from your force
	Tidy up colour of flame
	Allow to change flame size easily
	Add system failures
		What can fail:
			Energy Shield (Resilient, so low chance)
				How do you damage an energy shield?
					Only by non-shield knocks
					Things are pushed out of alignment
				- Stops working
				- Always on
			Battery (worse with side damage)
				- Stops working
				- Lights don't work
			Computer (only on high impact)
				Caused by shorts and interface damage
				So the dial is not actually broken, but it cannot read any data
				Easiest to just grey out the display, likely
				- Dials stop working
				- Lights stuck on
			Rocket (only on damage to rear of ship)
				- Nozzle angle changes
				- Lower power
				- Stuck on full power
				- Intermittent operation
			Gun (only on damage to front of ship)
				- Can't Fire
				- Constant Fire

	Enable types of rockets
		Let the player test everything virtually

- 12th Mar?

	Add screen to edit rocket
		This means we start to establise a rhythm to the game
			Bit of story.
			Setup rocket.
			Mission.
			Mission Results.
			Repeat.
		We have a simple 1 and a better 3 here, so add 2

- 19th March?

	Add results screen
		This is 4
	Add structure to handle the above repeats in code
		Add time

- 26th March?

	Do a cutscene
	Add the scene to decide where to go next
