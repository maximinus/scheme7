Rocket Technology
=================


Every ship has rockets. There are 2 basic types:

Chemical
	Runs hot and loud
	Needs fuel
	Can explode

Electrical
	Runs quiet
	Needs a battery
	Can short out
	Low power output


In the game, a chemical rocket has 2 parts:

Nozzle
	Directs force
	Increases engine efficiency

	If damaged:
		Can cause direction of engine force to be changed
		Decreases efficiency giving less thrust

Injectors
	Push fuel into nozzle
	Regulates engine power

	If damaged:
		Fuel flow can be changed
		Engine power can be reduced
		If it leaks, can exert a large force in a steady direction
		Can explode


Rockets have characteristics

The 3 stage cycle
	Stage 1: Ignition
		When you turn on a rocket, there at first a small flame that is used to ignite the larger.
		This means there is a pause between pressing the button and getting a force.
		The pilot flame does have some force, maybe 1/5 of the main force.

	Stage 2: Burn
		The main flame is operation

	Stage 3:
		The fuels in the nozzle do not instantly burn out and there may still be some fuel in
		the lines to burn for a while.
		However this is low pressure and is more easily controlled.

	Some engines can deliberatly be made to remain in the ignition phase. This results in:
		Fine tuned thrusts for low-g
		More fuel consumption


An Electric rocket has 2 parts

Batteries
	Power in (from engine to recharge)
	Power out (> in, battery drain, else batteries power)
	Battery capacity (how much energy can be stored)

	If damaged:
		Be intermitent
		Stop working
		Worse: Short out and cause a fire

Thruster
	What pushes. Requires a small amount of propellant.

	If damaged:
		Thrust in wrong direction


And 1 advanced type:


G-Drive

Uses anti-gravity waves to be controlled
Automatic landing, collision avoidance etc can be added
Operates on battery
Short operation
Very easy to stablise
Limited mass
Very small


"The King"

Ultimate craft can be obtained by some exploration.

Uses a G-Drive and some super modern light material with crazy batteries.
Can be used to cheese the last 1/3 of the game.
Comes with a story downbeat.
